                        It is extremely difficult to succinctly describe my journey of 730+ days in words less than one-tenth of it. But lemme try.
                        I have been working in a metaverse startup (WoWExp Technologies) for the last <span class="active">2 years as a UX Designer.</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>I have worked on multiple <span class="active">Augmented and Virtual Reality</span> projects where my skills in converting complex 
                        requirements into a simple flow were put to test. Other than AR and VR, I have also designed seamless 
                        navigations for Web3D experiences such as architectural interior exploration. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being the <span class="active">UX team of one</span>, I was responsible for everything, the stakeholder interviews to developer handoff. 
                        In 2 years, my skills were honed horizontally as well as vertically. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from this, I also have experience in designing websites for the E-commerce industry, 
                        B2B SaaS products for Social Media companies and Overseas Education Consultancy.

                                        Dharam was wonderful to work with. 
                                        We asked for many different variations during the design process of our designs and 
                                        he was very patient in working with us until we found the one that worked best for us. 
                                        He is very professional, easy to work with and very responsive. 
                                        I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for design services!
