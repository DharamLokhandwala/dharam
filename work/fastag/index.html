                        <h2>What is FASTag?</h2>
                        <p>
                            FASTag is a Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) introduced by the Government of
                            India
                            in October 2017 by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway. This measure was taken
                            keeping in
                            scrutiny several inconveniences for both individual drivers and the nation at large.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Why introduce FASTag?</h2>
                        <p>
                            As per statistics mentioned in a Times of India article, approximately Rs. 12000 crore is
                            leaked
                            annually in India at toll booth plazas. Two of the primary components of such loss are on
                            account of
                            fuel wastage and exhaustion of human resources at toll plazas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the monetary loss is a primary concern, another repercussion bypasses the common eye,
                            i.e.
                            air
                            pollution. India is one of the worst countries in terms of air pollution with more than 14
                            cities
                            exhibiting considerably high levels of air pollution which includes the national capital,
                            Delhi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Toll plaza, in that regard, is a primary contributor to the surge in air pollution levels in
                            India.
                            Hence, one of the agendas of implementing FASTag in India was to curtail such levels.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I started my researching journey from playstore, as the application had only 3.3 stars, with
                            many 1
                            star rating. So I thought this was the right place to start my research for users pain
                            point.
                        </p>

                        <h3>One-to-one interviews</h3>
                        <p>
                            The next step in research was to ask my friends and family members about the application
                            because
                            I
                            have many friends that travel frequently to out station and have the need for FASTag. I
                            interviewed
                            4 people, my uncle and three friends. Below mentioned were the questions asked by me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Q1. Do you frequently use this application? <br />
                            Q2. How do you feel using this application? <br />
                            Q3. Tell me about the time when you got stuck in the app <br />
                            Q4. How to recharge your FASTag wallet? <br />
                            Q5. How do you feel when you have to recharge your FASTag wallet? <br />
                            Q6. What changes to make in the current application according to you? <br />

                        <p>I found enough pain points from the reviews itself and interviews acted as the confirmation
                            to
                            these

                        <p>Therefore I have introduced one new feature of Trip Top-up. On entering the starting and
                            ending
                            destination, this feature will show the difference of amount a user needs to top-up in the

                        <p>I have researched about the problems faced by the users and I have an idea of how and what

                            be the structure of the application. Now is the part to design the low fidelity wireframes.

                        <p>The new feature was initially named as "Plan a Trip" but it didn't go well with the users,
                            that's
                            why I changed it to "Trip Topup". Label Plan a trip was confused as some kind of travel
                            package
                            instead of topping up for the trip.</p>

                            In the "Trip Topup" feature, initially we showed the number of tolls and total amount both.
                            When
                            user would click on pay, then it would show the difference amount. But this didn't play well
                            with the users. They just wanted to know the difference amount instead of other information
                            I
                            provided. So instead of showing number of tolls, I decided to show the amount in their
                            wallet
                            and the amount that needed to be paid for the Trip tolls.
