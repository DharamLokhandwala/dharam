                    <h1>Sharell</h1>
                    <p>In June 2020, India banned all the Chinese apps and among them was a very popular one called Xender. 
                        So, me and my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-a-41ab2b136/" target="_blank" style="color: var(--first-color);">Yash</a> decided to design and develop an app 
                        which can replace the popular file sharing app - Xender with a top-up of 
                        seamless user experience. This was a personal project which was allotted only 2 weeks 
                        to design because time was crucial as others were also developing the same app as us.</p>

                        <h2>What is Sharell?</h2>
                        <p>To establish some context here...Sharell is a free file sharing application which can 
                            transfer all types of files including photos, videos, apps, docs, zips, etc. Any device can 
                            share any type of file parallely with other devices regardless of the operating system and size of the file. 
                            A user can share files simultaneously with many other users.
                        </p>

                            The first thing I did was analyzed competitor's apps and reviews to find the pain 
                            points and base features for Sharell. 
                            I analyzed 4 apps in detail and used other few more apps just to try the experience and interface

                        <h3>One-to-one interviews</h3>
                        <p>
                            It was pandemic time in 2020 and everything was under lockdown, 
                            so I couldn't interview people physically but I managed to do so virtually. 
                            I asked few of my friends and family members 
                            some questions to have better clarity about the problems and needs of users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Q1. Do you frequently use this application? <br />
                            Q2. How do you feel using this application? <br />
                            Q3. Tell me about the time when you got stuck in the app <br />
                            Q4. How to send a PDF file from PC to mobile? <br />
                            Q5. What do you feel about the process of sending the photos? <br />
                            Q6. What changes to make in the current application according to you? <br />
                        </p>

                        <h1 class="title">What did I find out?</h1>
                        <p>I gathered all the information and pain points 
                            I could from the reviews and functionalities of competitor apps and user interviews. 
                            Below given is the gist of the insights that I found</p>
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li>Users want to have clear instructions in the app
                            </li>
                            <li>Sending file to/from the PC should not be complicated</li>
                            <li>Connecting other devices should be seamless</li>
                            <li>Users would like to have parallel sharing people i.e., both the devices able to simultaneously share files</li>
                            <li>File sharing should be lightning fast</li>
                            <li>History of files should be easily accessible</li>
                            <li>Should be easily change the destination of to-be-received files</li>
                        </ul>

                            I now have a strong foundation to lay out the structure of the app which minimises the user problems.

                        <h3>Appropriate naming</h3>
                        <p>In competitor analysis I found out that every app was using the 
                            convention of “send” and “receive” buttons but it seemed irrelevant in our case. 
                            Sharell has the feature of parallel sharing, so the users would be able to send and receive simultaneously. 
                            So here both the users are senders and receivers. Thus, if both the users want to share the files, 
                            the traditional naming convention would confuse them. 
                            Therefore, I decided to name “connect” and “create”, which was obviously tested  later and did good.
                        </p>
                        <img src="./images/appropriate naming.png" alt="Appropriate naming of the app" class="fullwidth">
                        <h3>Grouping and accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The main function of our app is to share files via Wi-Fi or hotspot connection. 
                            So, the connection and it’s related settings were grouped together and placed at the 
                            most accessible area of the mobile phone i.e., the bottom(According to the Thumb usage rule). 
                            Not only connection related settings but also the most 
                            frequently used functions like “progress” and “history” should be easily visible and accessible. 
                            So I grouped all the frequently used options in one navbar
                        </p>

                        <h3>Re-imagining the progress tab</h3>
                        <p>Progress bar in the apps I analyzed used tabs of sent and receives, 
                            but what I did was place them like chats. The received files on the left and 
                            sent files on the right. In this arrangement, the users need not recall 
                            which is the received file, but recognize the interface as it matches the chatting apps. 
                            This way of showing progress eliminates the need of toggling between 2 tabs.
                        </p>

                        <p>I designed a usability test plan and conducted the usability testing of the
                             wireframes to validate the seamless app flow. Test scenarios were given to the 
                             participants and their behavior was observed over online video call. Participants 
                             were encouraged to speak up whatever came to their mind while using the prototype and 
                             they were observed. Feedback received from the participants were analyzed, 
                            which gave me more clarity on the user’s thought process.
                        </p>

                        <p>From the usability testing I got to know the loopholes in the so-thought seamless flow. 
                            One major option lacking was the “Help” to guide users when they are stuck. 
                            It was the most obvious thing that I missed in my design, but thanks to usability testing.

                        <p>I have analyzed the reviews and other apps, got to know the 
                            pain points from the users, empathized with the users, made the basic structure of the app and now it's time 
                            to do the thing which will please the users eyes - visual designing.</p>

                        <p>Marketing is a very important aspect for any app's success, therefore I made a unique comic strip to market my app. 
                            It was just an experiment, but I got a quite nice response from audience.</p>
