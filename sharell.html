            <h1>Transforming the experience</h1>
            <p>In June 2020, India banned all the Chinese apps. Among them was a very popular one called Xender. This ban on Chinese apps gave me and many other designers and developers an opportunity to design & develop something beautiful for our country.

                I was part of an ambitious project to design an alternative of Xender(A Chinese File sharing app)

        <h4 class="subheading" >What is sharell?</h4>
        <p id="pad" class="normal-text">To establish some context here...Sharell is a free file sharing application which can transfer all types of files including photos, videos, apps, docs, zips, etc. Any device can share any type of file parallely with other devices regardless of the operating system and size of the file. A user can share files simultaneously with many other users. We focused on the below points</p>

            <p class="normal-text">File sharing application is a very common tool, so the analysis of competitors plays an important role in providing insights on the features of the app. This would help our app to introduce a feature that has not been introduced till now by the competitors and would make our app stand out from others(feature wise). It will also give us an idea of their user experience and interface.

                So, here is my competitor Analysis

            <h1 class="heading">DESIGNING FOR WHAT USERS WANT</h1>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Synthesising goals from our user research served as a lens through which we could consider not only what the app should do, but also how it should feel. We believed this would be the difference between delivering a good experience and a great one.
Below given are the few changes that I made to the traditional file sharing design.

            </p>

            <div class="row">
                
                <div class="col s12 m6 l4">
                    <h4 class="subheading black-text" >Apropriate Naming</h4>
                    <p id="pad" class="normal-text">
                        In competitor analysis we found out every app was using the convention of “send” and “receive” buttons but it seemed irrelevant in our case. Sharell has the feature of parallel sharing, so the users would be able to send and receive simultaneously. So here both the users are sender and receiver. So if both the users wanted to share the files, the traditional naming convention would confuse them. Thus, we decided to name “connect” and “create”, which did much better in user testing.

                    </p>
                    <img src="./images/naming.png" alt="Sharell naming convention" class="responsive-img">

                <div class="col s12 m6 l4 ">
                    <h4 class="subheading black-text" >Grouping and accessibility</h4>
                    <p id="pad" class="normal-text">
                        The main function of our app is to share files via WiFi or hotspot connection. So, the connection and it’s related settings were grouped together and placed at the most accessible area of the mobile phone i.e., the bottom(According to the Thumb usage rule). Not only connection related settings but also the most required and necessary functions like “progress” and “history”
                    </p>
                    <img src="./images/grouping.png" alt="Sharell naming convention" class="responsive-img">

                <div class="col s12 m6 l4 ">
                    <h4 class="subheading black-text" >Not the normal progress tab</h4>
                    <p id="pad" class="normal-text">
                        Progress needs to show the sent and received files, the traditional method to show them was by using the tabs of sent and received. But what we did was place them like chats. The received files on the left and sent files on the right. In this arrangement, the users did not need to recall, but recognize the interface as it matches the chatting apps.

            <p class="normal-text">
                We designed a usability test plan and conducted the usability testing of the wire-frame prototype to validate the application design. Test scenarios were given to the participants and their behavior was observed. Participants were encouraged to speak up whatever came to their mind while using the prototype and they were observed. Feedback received from the participants were analyzed, which gave us more clarity for the application design system and the user’s thought process.

            <p class="normal-text">
                From the usability testing we got to know the loopholes in our experience. One major thing lacking was the “Help” button to guide users when they are stuck. It was the most obvious thing that we missed in our experience design, but thanks to usability testing. After fixing the issues we discovered from the usability testing, we conducted another round of usability testing with different users and the results were much more satisfying than before.
